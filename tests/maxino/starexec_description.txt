Maxino is based on the kProcessCore algorithm, a parametric algorithm generalizing OLL, ONE and PMRES.
Parameter k is dynamically determined for each processed unsatisfiable core by a function taking into account the size of the core.
Satisfiability of propositional theories is checked by means of a pseudo boolean solver extending Glucose 4.1 single thread.
